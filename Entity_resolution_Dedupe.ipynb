    "The dedupe library can:\n",
    "1. Remove duplicate entries from a spreadsheet of names and addresses\n",
    "2. Link a list of (customer) information to another (order) history, even without unique (customer) id’s\n",
    "3. Take a database of campaign contributions and figure out which ones were made by the same person, even if the names were entered slightly differently for each record\n",
    "4. Takes in human training data and comes up with the best rules for your dataset to quickly and automatically find similar records, even with very large databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Features:\n",
    "1. Machine learning – reads in human labeled data to automatically create optimum weights and blocking rules\n",
    "2. Runs on a laptop – makes intelligent comparisons so you don’t need a powerful server to run it\n",
    "3. Built as a library – so it can be integrated into applications or import scripts\n",
    "4. Extensible – supports adding custom data types, string comparators and blocking rules\n",
    "5. Open source"

    "\n",
    "- Most widely used gap penalty function\n",
    "- The affine gap penalty combines the components in both the **constant** and **linear gap penalty**, taking the form $ A + B.L $\n",

    "    - $L$: length of the gap\n",
    "- Note that the Affine Gap Penalty Model is simply the Constant Gap Weight Model when $B = 0$.\n",
    "- In general:\n",
    "    - if the interest is to find closely related matches (e.g. removal of vector sequence during genome sequencing), a higher gap penalty should be used to reduce gap openings\n",
    "    - On the other hand, gap penalty should be lowered when interested in finding a more distant match.\n",
    "- The relationship between A and B also have an effect on gap size.\n",
    "    - If the size of the gap is important, a small A and large B (more costly to extend a gap) is used and vice versa\n",
    "    - Only the ratio A/B is important, as multiplying both by the same positive constant k will increase all penalties by k: kA+kBL = k(A+BL) which does not change the relative penalty between different alignments.\n",
